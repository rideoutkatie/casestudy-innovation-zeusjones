			 <h3>Start small and socialize your plan.</h3>		
			 <p>Don’t oversell it — show it. And show it early. Make it tangible. Define what you want to make or do, assemble a small team, and transform that idea from a wall of Post-it® notes into a prototype – in weeks, not months. Use tools like Keynote or Sketch — or clay and cardboard — to create a low-fidelity version of your idea. Then walk around and show it to other people — maybe even a select group of customers. Ask for feedback and use what you hear to make it better.

By moving quickly, modeling humility, and demonstrating your willingness to make improvements based on what you hear, you create a precedent that will help your company understand what innovation can do.

Why should I listen to you, Zeus Jones?
We didn’t just make this stuff up.

Because we’re passionate about innovation and dedicate ourselves to helping people do more of it, we set out to figure out what was standing in its way. We surveyed employees from a wide range of industries — retail, CPG, health care, banking, technology, and food — and asked them what was stopping them from creating the future they wanted to see. The barriers you see here came from them. The tips? They came from us.

If you’re looking for ways to solve your innovation challenges and move your business into the future, that’s what we do every day. We’d love to hear from you.</p>
